## 📖 Demo Script (3-5 Minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)

> **"Hi! I'm [your name] and I built Pipeline Whisperer - an autonomous GTM agent that learns which outreach messages convert best."**
>
> **"The problem: Sales teams waste time manually personalizing emails and guessing which message style works. Pipeline Whisperer solves this with AI-powered lead scoring and autonomous A/B testing."**

### Part 1: Show the Dashboard (45 seconds)

**Navigate to:** http://localhost:3000

**Point out these cards:**

1. **Overview Cards** (top row)
   - "We have 26 leads ingested from our CRM"
   - "12 have been contacted with personalized outreach"
   - "9 converted to opportunities - that's a 75% conversion rate!"

2. **Pipeline Funnel** (left side)
   - "Leads flow through our autonomous pipeline"
   - "From ingestion → AI scoring → Personalization → Multi-channel outreach"

3. **A/B Experiments** (right side)
   - "We're running 3 experiments simultaneously"
   - "Thompson Sampling automatically learns which message style works best"
   - "Notice the alpha/beta parameters - these update as we get conversion data"

### Part 2: Show Live AI Scoring (60 seconds)

**Open terminal and run:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=apps/agent-api apps/agent-api/.venv/bin/python -c "
from app.services.openai_scoring_client import get_openai_scoring_client

client = get_openai_scoring_client()

# Live scoring demo
lead = {
    'company_name': 'TechCorp Enterprise',
    'industry': 'technology',
    'employee_count': 850,
    'revenue': 45000000,
    'website': 'techcorp.com'
}

result = client.score_lead(lead)
print(f'Company: {lead[\"company_name\"]}')
print(f'Employees: {lead[\"employee_count\"]:,}')
print(f'Revenue: \${lead[\"revenue\"]:,}')
print(f'AI Score: {result[\"score\"]}')
print(f'Persona: {result[\"persona\"]}')
print(f'Reasoning: {result[\"reasoning\"]}')
print(f'Using Real GPT-4o-mini: {not result.get(\"mock\", False)}')
"
```

**Say:**
> **"Watch this - I'm scoring a lead in real-time using GPT-4o-mini."**
>
> **"850 employees, $45M revenue → Gets a score of 0.9 and classified as 'enterprise'"**
>
> **"The AI explains why: 'Large technology company with strong revenue and employee base'"**

### Part 3: Explain the Architecture (45 seconds)

**Show the tech stack:**

> **"Here's what makes this interesting:"**
>
> 1. **"Event-driven with Kafka"** - All components communicate via events
> 2. **"Thompson Sampling"** - Bayesian multi-armed bandit for experiment selection
> 3. **"OpenAI GPT-4o-mini"** - Real AI lead scoring (not heuristics!)
> 4. **"Graceful degradation"** - If any service fails, we fall back to mock mode
> 5. **"Full observability"** - Every event logged for feedback loop

### Part 4: Show Autonomous Learning (30 seconds)

**Point to the experiments table:**

> **"Notice these alpha/beta parameters?"**
>
> **"When a lead converts, the system automatically updates these priors."**
>
> **"Over time, the best-performing experiments get selected more often."**
>
> **"It's fully autonomous - no human intervention needed!"**

### Closing (30 seconds)

> **"To recap:**
> - ✅ AI-powered lead scoring with GPT-4o-mini
> - ✅ Autonomous experiment selection with Thompson Sampling
> - ✅ Event-driven architecture with Kafka
> - ✅ Full feedback loop for continuous learning
>
> **"This is production-ready for any B2B sales team. Questions?"**
